# Intro to JSX
## Attributes In JSX

JSX elements can have attributes, just like how HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

    my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"

Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

    <a href='http://www.example.com'>Welcome to the Web</a>;

    const title = <h1 id='title'>Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>; 

A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

    const panda = <img src='images/panda.jpg' alt='panda' width='500px' height='500px'>;
