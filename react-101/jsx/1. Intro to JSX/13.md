# Intro to JSX
## The Virtual DOM

One special thing about a React root’s `render()` method is that it only updates DOM elements that have changed.

That means that if you render the exact same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing:

    const hello = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

    // This will add "Hello world" to the screen:
    root.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));

    // This won't do anything at all:
    root.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));

This is significant! Only updating the necessary DOM elements is a large part of what makes React so successful. This is accomplished using React’s virtual DOM.
