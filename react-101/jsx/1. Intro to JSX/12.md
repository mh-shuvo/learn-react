# Intro to JSX
## Passing a Variable to render()

In the previous exercise, we saw how we can create a React root using `createRoot()` and use its `render()` method to render JSX.

The `render()` method’s argument doesn’t need to be JSX, but it should evaluate to a JSX expression. The argument could also be a variable, so long as that variable evaluates to a JSX expression.

In this example, we save a JSX expression as a variable named `toDoList`. We then pass `toDoList` as the argument of `render()`:

    const toDoList = (
    <ol>
        <li>Learn React</li>
        <li>Become a Developer</li>
    </ol>
    );

    const container = document.getElementById('app');
    const root = createRoot(container);
    root.render(toDoList);

### Instruction

### Practice Code

    import React from 'react';
    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

    const container = document.getElementById('app');
    const root = createRoot(container);

    //write your code

#### Task 1

- On line 7, declare a variable named myList. Set myList equal to a JSX `<ul>` element. Wrap your `<ul></ul>` tags in parentheses.

- Add several `<li>` elements in between your `<ul></ul>` tags. Put some text in each `<li></li>` tags. Use line breaks and indentations similar to the above example.

#### Task 2
- At the bottom of the file, use root and call its `render()` method with myList as an argument.
