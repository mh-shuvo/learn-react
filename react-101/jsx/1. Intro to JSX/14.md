# Intro to JSX
## Review

Congratulations! You’ve learned to create and render JSX elements! This is the first step toward becoming fluent in React.

In this lesson, we learned that:

- React is a modular, scalable, flexible, and popular front-end framework.
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript which allows us to treat HTML as expressions.
        They can be stored in variables, objects, arrays, and more!
- JSX elements can have attributes and be nested within each other, just like in HTML.
- JSX must have exactly one outer element, and other elements can be nested inside.
- createRoot() from react-dom/client can be used to create a React root at the specified DOM element.
- A React root’s render() method can be used to render JSX on the screen.
- A React root’s render() method only updates DOM elements that have changed using the virtual DOM.

As you continue to learn more about React, you’ll learn some powerful things you can do with JSX, some common JSX issues, and how to avoid them.
