# Advanced JSX
## React.createElement

You can write React code without using JSX at all!

The majority of React programmers do use JSX, but you should understand that it is possible to write React code without it.

The following JSX expression:

    const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;

    can be rewritten without JSX, like this:

    const h1 = React.createElement(
    "h1",
    null,
    "Hello world"
    );

When a JSX element is compiled, the compiler transforms the JSX element into the method that you see above: `React.createElement()`. Every JSX element is secretly a call to `React.createElement()`.

We wonâ€™t go in-depth into how `React.createElement()` works, but check out the React documentation on createElement() to learn more.

### Practice code on
    
    //app.js
    const greatestDivEver = React.createElement();

### Instrucitons 

#### Task 1

Take a look at the following JSX element:

    const greatestDivEver = <div>i am div</div>;

In `app.js`, create the above element without using JSX.
