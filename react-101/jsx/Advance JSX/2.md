# Advanced JSX
## Self-Closing Tags

Another common JSX error involves self-closing tags.

What’s a self-closing tag?

Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag `(<div>)`, and a closing tag `(</div>`). However, some HTML elements such as `<img>` and `<input>` use only one tag. The tag that belongs to a single-tag element isn’t an opening tag or a closing tag; it’s a self-closing tag.

When you write a self-closing tag in HTML, it is optional to include a forward slash immediately before the final angle bracket:

    // Fine in HTML with a slash:
    <br />

    // Also fine, without the slash:
    <br>

But, in JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

    // Fine in JSX:
    <br />

    // NOT FINE AT ALL in JSX:
    <br>


### Practice on code

    const profile = (
    <div>
        <h1>John Smith</h1>
        <img src="images/john.png">
        <article>
        My name is John Smith.
        <br>
        I am a software developer.
        <br>
        I specialize in creating React applications.
        </article>
    </div>
    );

### Instructions 

#### Task 1

In `app.js`, fix the broken JSX by adding slashes to all of the self-closing tags.
