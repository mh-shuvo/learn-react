# Components and Advanced JSX
## Putting Logic in a Function Component

A function component must have a return statement. However, that isn’t all that it can have.

You can also put simple calculations that need to happen before returning your JSX element within the function component.

Here’s an example of some calculations that can be done inside a function component:

    function RandomNumber() {
    //First, some logic that must happen before returning
    const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
    //Next, a return statement using that logic: 
    return <h1>{n}</h1>
    }

Watch out for this common mistake:

    function RandomNumber() {
    return (
        const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
        <h1>{n}</h1>
    )
    }

In the above example, the line with the const n declaration will cause a syntax error, as it should come before the return.

### Practice Code 

#### Friend.js

    const friends = [
    {
        title: "Yummmmmmm",
        src: "https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-monkeyweirdo.jpg"
    },
    {
        title: "Hey Guys! Wait Up!",
        src: "https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-earnestfrog.jpg"
    },
    {
        title: "Yikes",
        src: "https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-alpaca.jpg"
    }
    ];

    // New function component starts here:


#### App.js

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

    import Friend from './Friend'

    function App() {
    return <Friend />;
    }

    export default App


### Instructions

#### Task 1

- Let’s make a function component with some logic in it.

- Start by importing React from the React library at the top of the Friend.js file.


#### Task 2

- Create a new function component named Friend.

- Your function component should just return an empty `<div>` for now.

#### Task 3

- Although you’re not done with the component, export it so that you can see your progress being rendered in the browser window as you work.

- At the bottom of your Friend.js file, default export your Friend component.


#### Task 4

- Time to add some logic.

- Before the return statement, declare a new variable named friend.

- Set friend equal to either `friends[0], friends[1], or friends[2]`, depending on which friend sounds most appealing to you.


#### Task 5

- Inside the `<div>` element in the return statement, add an `<h1>` element.

- Inside of the `<h1></h1>` tags, inject friend.title.


#### Task 6

- Finally, let’s meet your new friend by adding a picture of them.

- Still inside of the `<div></div>` tags, make a new line after the `<h1></h1>` tags.

- On the new line, add an `<img />` element. Give the `<img />` tag an attribute of src with the value of {friend.src}.
