# Components and Advanced JSX
## Use a Variable Attribute in a Component

Take a look at this JavaScript object named redPanda:

    const redPanda = {
    src: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Endangered_Red_Panda.jpg',
    alt: 'Red Panda',
    width: '200px'
    };

How could you render a React component with an image of redPanda and its properties?

Select `RedPanda.js` to see one way to do this.

Note all the curly brace JavaScript injections inside the return statement. You can, and often will, inject JavaScript into JSX inside the return statement.

### Practice Code

#### RedPanda.js

    import React from 'react';

    const redPanda = {
    src: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Endangered_Red_Panda.jpg',
    alt: 'Red Panda',
    width:  '200px'
    };

    function RedPanda(){
        return (
        <div>
            <h1>Cute Red Panda</h1>
            <img 
            src={redPanda.src}
            alt={redPanda.alt}
            width={redPanda.width} />
        </div>
        );
    }

    export default RedPanda;

#### Owl.js

    const owl = {
    title: 'Excellent Owl',
    src: 'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-owl.jpg'
    };

    //Define function component here:

#### App.js

    import React from 'react';
    import Owl from './Owl'

    function App() {
        return (
        <Owl />
        );
    };

    export default App;



### Instructions

#### Task 1

- Select `Owl.js`.

- Start by importing React from the React library.

#### Task 2
- Let’s create our component.

- In `Owl.js`, declare a new function component named Owl. Owl should return an empty `<div></div>`.

- Feel free to use `RedPanda.js` for guidance.

#### Task 3

- Although you’re not done with the component, export it so that you can see your progress being rendered in the browser window as you work.

- At the bottom of the `Owl.js` file, default export your Owl component.


#### Task 4

- Our owl object has 2 properties, title and src which has a link to an image. We’ll display both of these, starting with the title.

- Nest an `<h1>` element inside of your `<div>` element.

- Use the value of owl.title as the content of the `<h1>` element. Remember, you will have to use curly braces to access owl.title, since it is a JavaScript property.

- Don’t forget to wrap the whole multi-line JSX expression in parentheses!

#### Task 5


- Still inside of the `<div></div>` tags, make a new line after the `<h1></h1>` tags.

- On your new line, add an `<img />` element.

- Your `<img />` should have two attributes:

    * an src of owl.src
    * an alt of owl.title
