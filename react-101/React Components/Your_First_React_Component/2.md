# Your First React Component
## Import React

The first React component we created in the last exercise started with importing react. The line that did this is:

    import React from 'react';

This creates an object named React, which contains methods necessary to use the React library. React is imported from the 'react' package, which should be installed in your project as a dependency. With the object, we can start utilizing features of the react library!

By importing the library, we can use important features such as Hooks, which we’ll explore in detail later.

For the next few exercises, we’ll be working in two files: App.js and index.js. In a React application, the App.js file typically is the top level of your application, and index.js is the entry point.


### Instructions


* In line 1 of App.js, use import to import the React library. Save the library in a variable named React.
Checkpoint 2 Passed


* index.js also needs React.

    In line 1 of index.js, use import to import the React library. Save the library in a variable named React.
