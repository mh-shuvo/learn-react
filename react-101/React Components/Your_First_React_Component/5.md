# Your First React Component
## Name a Functional Component

Good! Creating a JavaScript function is the way to declare a new functional component.

When you declare a new functional component, you need to give that component a name. On our finished component, our componentâ€™s name was MyComponent:

    function MyComponent() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
    }

Function component names must start with capitalization and are conventionally created with PascalCase! Due to how JSX tags are compiled, capitalization indicates that it is a React component rather than an HTML tag.

This is a React-specific nuance! If you are creating a component, be sure to name it starting with a capital letter so it interprets it as a React component. If it begins with a lowercase letter, React will begin looking for a built-in component such as div and input instead and fail.

### Instructions

Edit the code so that the functional component is named `MyComponent` with a capitalized first letter and follows the Pascal case naming convention.
