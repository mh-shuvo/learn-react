## Use a Conditional in a Function Component

How might you use a conditional statement inside of a function component?

Select TodaysPlan.js to see one way of doing it.

Notice that the if statement is located inside of the function component, but before the return statement.


### Practice Code on

#### TodaysPlan.js

    import React from 'react';

    function TodaysPlan() {
        let task;
        let apocalypse = false;
        if (!apocalypse) {
        task = 'learn React.js'
        } else {
        task = 'run around'
        }
        return <h1>Today I am going to {task}!</h1>;
    }

    export default TodaysPlan;

#### TonightsPlan.js

    import React from 'react';

    const fiftyFifty = Math.random() < 0.5;

    // New function component starts here:
