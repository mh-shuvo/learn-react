# Your First React Component
## React Components

React applications are made of components.

What’s a component?

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML and re-render it when some data changes.

Take a look at the code below. This code will create and render a new React component:

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

    function MyComponent() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
    }

    ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById('app')
    ).render(<MyComponent />);

A lot of these look unfamiliar but do not worry. We are going to unpack that code, one small piece at a time. By the end of this lesson, you’ll understand how to build a React component!

### Practice Code 1 

    //index.js
    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

    import App from './App';

    ReactDOM.createRoot(
    document.getElementById('app')
    ).render(<App />);

### Practice Code 2 
    //App.js
    import React from 'react';

    function App() {
    return <h1>Hello again, World!</h1>;
    }

    export default App;
