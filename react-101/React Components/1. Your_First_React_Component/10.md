# Your First React Component
## Review

In this lesson, you’ve learned about a foundational React concept: components.

Before you go, here’s a recap:

- React applications are made up of components.
- Components are responsible for rendering pieces of the user interface.
    To create components and render them, react and reactDOM must be imported.
- React components can be defined with Javascript functions to make function components.
- Function component names must start with a capitalized letter, and Pascal case is the adopted naming convention.
- Function components must return some React elements in JSX syntax.
    React components can be exported and imported from file to file.
- A React component can be used by calling the component name in an HTML-like self-closing tag syntax.
- Rendering a React component requires using `.createRoot()` to specify a root container and calling the `.render()` method on it.

Phew! That was a lot, but components are at the core of React and they’re one of the reasons why React is such a powerful tool!

### Instructions
#### Task 1

If you would like to practice your learned skills, consider these challenges:

- Create a new JavaScript file in the file directory. Inside, define a new function component and export it.
- Modify the existing code to render the newly defined component to the browser screen.
