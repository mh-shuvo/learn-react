# Components Render Other Components
## Components Interact

A React application can contain dozens, or even hundreds, of components.

Each component might be small and relatively unremarkable on its own. When combined, however, they can form enormous, fantastically complex ecosystems of information.

In other words, React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isnâ€™t the components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.

This lesson is an introduction to components interacting. After this lesson, you should be familiar with:

- how this allows us to separate our components into separate files.
- how components can reference other components.
